The main goal of this project is to create a good common ground for a hierarchical and multilingual Django CMS.

Assuming it's very difficult to create a CMS that please everybody, this CMS aim to be simple and flexible enough to be easily extensible.

For this I think it's important to

  1. Have a logical and simple code base
  1. Have a good documentation of the all the CMS features
  1. Integrate well with Django and other Django applications
  1. Don't go too far in the functionalities by letting other projects implement advanced functionalities that are not the core business of this CMS.
